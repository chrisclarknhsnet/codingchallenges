Could someone please answer the query below:
Hi 

Can you please help, the indicator on the toolkit 1.6.2 see below (a): is about paper records, However the big picture guidance see (b) is all about technical controls am I missing something would be really grateful for you guidance re this indicator.

(A)

How does your organisation make sure that paper records are safe when taken out of the building? 
Paper records may be taken out of your organisation?s building(s), for example for hospital appointments or visits to people?s homes. Leaving documents in cars, for instance, can be risky. How does your organisation make sure paper records are kept safe when ?on the move?? 

(B)

There are technical controls that prevent information from being inappropriately copied or downloaded. Data Security Standard 1.6.2

"Dislike","Like","The wording of this toolkit feels as if it is intended for a large organisation - for most of our staff in our small business the issue of data security is a simple one in view of the data they have access to and responsibility for, and to expect, for example, that 95% of our staff should undergo a special training program for this seems ludicrous when there are far more relevant areas of training they would need to carry out their jobs as carers well and safely.  For many of our staff this level of information is overwhelming and incomprehensible. In my opinion, this toolkit has been written by someone working on behalf of the massive NHS, which employs many many administrative and managerial staff, and taking no account of the kind of small organisation (comprising mostly carers and domestic staff) that is needing to now fill this in.  I would also add that the entire NHS mail system has caused me more problems and wasted more of my time to sort, than seems reasonable in terms of its value to us.  However, I am nervous of opting out as we are often using Microsoft teams for NHS and DCC meetings and I believe we need NHS Mail for this.  Other than that, I do not feel that this is a worthwhile use of my very precious time, and causes needless stress and anxiety. We have so many other and more vital demands upon us right now that this feels like a huge imposition and worry.  I am sure this is very easy to complete when you have IT and Information handling departments. We do not have an IT department, we do not even have a person who has skills in this area, we just have to try and learn and incorporate this into our main jobs which are around the actual day to day care of real people.  This is not in our comfort zone and we small businesses cannot be expected to employ specialists to advise and support us in fielding these kind of questions and making action plans to adhere to what feels like disproportionate requirements.
I apologise for my irritation.","CLASSIC CARE HOMES (DEVON) LTD","A49R","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/ActionPlan","Henrietta Coxon","summercourtcare@gmail.com","Apr 14 2021  8:40AM"

"Like","Like","We are currently in the process of completing Cyber Essentials Plus, and we would like to be working on the DSPT at the same time.  However, there is no way to start filling in the DSPT on the basis of CE+ being in effect, without having already completed CE+ and receiving the certificate.  It would be incredibly useful if you could specify that CE+ was in progress, so that all the questions were tailored on the basis of CE+ being completed, even though it hasn't yet been awarded.  This would mean you could work on both of them in parallel.  As it is, we can't do any DSPT work until CE+ is achieved, which will set us back at least a month and is quite frustrating.","MALDABA","L6V9X","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","Mark Clements","mark@maldaba.co.uk","Apr 12 2021  9:16AM"

1. Although our CyberEssentials cert ran out in Jan, NCSC have advised that all current certs will now expire at the end of June (due to IASME taking over as the single Assessment body) - the profile page does not allow for this extension so I had to alter the date but I also loaded the extension notice from NCSC.
2. Where controls are met by having either ISO27001 and/or CyberEssentials and no evidence is required these do not show the NHS advice when the assessment is downloaded - I copied your advice for each point in question and put it into the COMMENTS box so anyone reviewing the spreadsheet could visibly see your advice.","REED Wellbeing LTD","DM9","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/Publications","Alan Downey","alan.downey@reed.com","Mar 31 2021 12:40PM"

I am growing frustrated at the fact that the new toolkit isn't yet available to work on - the deadline has closed for the last one and there are only 5 months before we need to publish our next assessment but I can't confirm the final wording of the questions or make a start on updating it. 

Please can the next release be made available ASAP? 

Thanks

While this toolkit is appropriate for larger organistions with independent IT departments including Optician practices with multiple outlets (i.e. the Specsavers or equivalent) the DSPT is way over the top for a single independent Opticians.  Yet again the NHS is operating a ""One size fits all"".  The person who decided this for opticians needs a good talking to.  As an person with IT background I fera for other independent Opticians who will have to bring in external support to answer this document (at considerable cost).  To make it a mandatory item for being bale to use Opera is unnecessary.

I am completely confused - we are a small company with no specialist department dealing with this and I feel that we are assumed to know more than we do. I am informed we are meant to do some kind of update (what? Where? How?) with this every year so I did something but very likely to be the wrong thing. Very stressful when we have so much else on our plates this year.","CLASSIC CARE HOMES (DEVON) LTD","A49R","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","Henrietta Coxon","summercourtcare@gmail.com","Oct  5 2020 11:46AM"

"Dislike","Like","I found using the toolkit for the first time quite challenging and struggled with the content and wording. It was also quite lengthy and felt some of the questions could have been reduced and merged into each other, not very user friendly. 
I will need to revisit some of the sections and relook at them adding more content and getting further information form or website team and It department.

"Dislike","Like","The wording needs to be simplified to enable easier understanding by personnel who are panicking about submitting such a substantial amount of very important information and submitting it with the correct content.  This whole process is like taking an exam or having a CQC visit.  The PM's workload is beyond incomprehensible and in a smaller practice - worse.  To then be subjected to this amount of time-consuming work and worry is horrendous.  I understand the necessity for checking all this information is on board, however, surely there must be a simpler way of completing this arduous task?","Hadlow Medical Centre (G82754)","G82754","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Profile/Confirm","Annie Ghent","annie.ghent@nhs.net","Sep 29 2020 10:00AM"

Also note that some questions suggest approaches that are absolutely no longer best (or even good) practice and should be amended based on current cyber guidance (screensavers - for heaven's sake, we don't live in the 90's! :-) )

I understand that you should have copies of the answers elsewhere ready for inputting which I do, but it's still frustrating when you're copying and pasting them and it logs your out spontaneously, without warning. It makes the process very frustrating, please fix.","DAMIBU LTD","8JP11","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","maja lorkowska","maja_lorkowska@damibu.com","Feb 28 2020  9:53AM"

"Like","Like","Generally, this survey/questionnaire is really good and very easy to use.

The only real problem with the service is that you are logged out 'due to inactivity' whilst you are actively entering data. I initially thought it was due to having spent too long within a pop-up and that activity within the pop-up was not being recognised by the site but I think I have actually just been logged out after 20-30 mins each time so I think it must be doing so after a set time irrespective of activity.

Some other minor points:
- It would be great if the page could be revised and we could enter per section that we are verifying as opposed to for each statement as the amount of clicking and reloading is not ideal for such a large questionnaire.
- There are some grammatical errors throughout.","HICOM TECHNOLOGY","8HJ34","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","Chloe Isherwood","chloe.isherwood@hicom.co.uk","Feb 20 2020 11:13AM"

"Dislike","Dislike","The old IG Toolkit was much clearer, more specific and allowed an incremental staged approach to working towards the highest standards.  

The DSP Toolkit disincentives such an approach as it presents a binary achieved/not achieved approach.  

Also GP systems are supported by external CCG-procured IT support services - they provide the scantest of information to help us complete the toolkit, and do not provided documents to upload.  Some standards require you to upload a document or you cannot sign as complete - thus the end result is a false impression.

A very poor system.  Bring back the old toolkit.","De Parys Medical Centre","E81037","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","carolyn boyd","carolyn.boyd1@nhs.net","Feb  4 2020  5:34PM"

The progress status at the top right needs to be consistent, evidence items only cover mandated ones, but the confirmed assertion include all both mandated and none mandated, this has proved to be an issue when reporting progress to SIRO, can the assertions be changed to read mandated confirmed???","COUNTY DURHAM AND DARLINGTON NHS FOUNDATION TRUST","RXP","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","Alison Malpass","alison.malpass@nhs.net","Dec 13 2019  9:39AM"

"Dislike","Like","I run a very small  operation. The constant references to Directors and Board are simply not appropriate to us and neither are all the plans sign off from senior management etc.  To comply I will have to fabricate documents as evidence that  I have talked to myself, consulted with myself and been at a meeting with myself to make decision on IG etc.   It is disproportionate and disheartening and will eventually add the the pressure to sell up to large corporate entities. Sour grapes perhaps but nevertheless true.","PAUL ADLER OPTOMETRISTS (TP431)","TP431","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/Details?assertion=9.4","Paul ADLER","paul.adler@eyezone.co.uk","Nov 24 2019  1:59PM"

"Like","Like","EKHUFT has been awarded the Cyber Essentials Plus Accreditation  11.04.2018.  It is our understanding that this certificate remains valid with a recommended re-assessment date: April 10th, 2019. 

The re assessment from Intertek NTA took place in March 2019 and full report and re assessment details expected Oct/Nov 2019

Cyber Security Certificate no.: 4379544125301311

The system does not allow for a 'yes' response with this information therefore 'Unsure' was selected until the re assessment report and certificate arrives.

Feed back : I think a comments box is needed in this section of the base-lining process.

Many Thanks and Kind regards

What would really help is to issue a pdf to demonstrate a compliant submission/publication. All NHS customers ask for proof of DSP compliance, and one of the items is the toolkit submission. The only documents I can now present are screenshots of the publication page and of the confirmation email. It would be great if that confirmation email contained an attachment that lists the necessary detail to demonstrate a compliant publication.

Please could you advice where I can find guides on how to asses two items for DSPT:
?	1.7.2  Data quality metrics and reports are used to assess and improve data quality. 
?	1.7.3 A data quality forum monitors the effectiveness of data quality assurance processes.
Last time I contacted your team I have been told that guides should be available early this year. I keep checking but unfortunately cannot find anything.
Many thanks,

What is the likelihood that citizens rights have been affected? - the descriptions are not inline (in my opinion) with the answers. For example, Yes it has occurred but no, an adverse effect has not been reported as a result of the incident. (The data subject doesn't know yet so there may be none but this doesn't mean their rights haven't been affected) The adverse effect is again addressed in the severity of the adverse effect question, which is clearly a different question and easier to respond to, I do think they could improve this with more examples to help.","NORTHAMPTON GENERAL HOSPITAL NHS TRUST","RNS","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Incidents/15847/Confirmation","Sally Shocklidge","sally.shocklidge@ngh.nhs.uk","Sep 10 2019  4:09PM"

"Dislike","Dislike","When you print off the assertions spreadsheet it only identifies assertions at a level of 1.1.3.  Whereas it would be useful to have Assertion 1 Name, then the subheading of 1.1.  It would also be useful to have the description pulled into the spreadsheet for each assertion as you keep having to refer to the DSPT on the internet.

Please can you  confirm when the Big Picture Guides for 1, 3-10 will be published, as it is difficult to progress with the new requirements and what you  expect as evidence.

"Dislike","Dislike","regulatory requirements could have been made as a black and white statements of what is required, rather than keeping it grey, imposing extensive hardship on time and resources, which could have been effectively deployed in professional improvement and delivery of service. Legal regulation is good as long as it doesn't have its impact on the progression of the profession and the professional's skills.","Chelwood Dental Practice (V03907)","V03907","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/Publications","dix premsingh prasath","esteemdental01@yahoo.com","Apr  7 2019  8:48PM"

As an independant opticians, I found this toolkit used a lot of jargon and initials, especially difficult if not part of the NHS system or with much IT knowledge. The help pages were particularly unhelpful and I found little relevant to very small businesses or opticians. If there were recommendations for policy document examples or templates, I failed to find any.

There are a number of areas outwith GP control which would be better not to even appear e.g. data held by NECs or TPP.
 I am wondering what it will look like when I file it and what penalties there are if it is not considered correctly filled.

"Dislike","Like","Some of the wording is very technical, way beyond what I have any knowledge of.

I have not been able to answer some of the mandatory questions.  These are ALL about information theoretically available from my PMR supplier, which automatically pre-populates when I put my IT supplier on the system.  Unfortunately, as these standards have apparently only been published very recently, my IT supplier has insufficient time to get their system onto your database.  As a consequence, I don't feel I can confirm those questions myself in a truthful way.","ST DENNIS PHARMACY (FCN04)","FCN04","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Published","ian bloxham","stdennispharmacy@hotmail.co.uk","Mar 30 2019 10:13AM"

Many of the assentation's took time to workout what was actually meant by the question.

some of the assentation's are not relevant to General Practice. I had to write lists for lists sake, which took hours of my time  - we are a practice with one drawer for contracts - what was the point of writing a list of each contract - we already have an annual review process - we just go to the draw to find the information - it took me 5 hours of time just to go through my contracts drawer and all invoice folders to compile this information. I understand how in a hospital this would be necessary due to the size and complexity of the organisation but frankly in a GP Practice this has added hours of work on an unnecessary process.","Sherbourne Medical Centre (M84040)","M84040","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","jane eite","jane.eite@sherbourne.nhs.uk","Mar 29 2019  2:53PM"

Whilst I understand that the tool needs to accommodate all types and sizes of concern, several of the assertions are simply not meaningfully answerable in our case.
My concern is being forced to provide answers (to move on the toolkit) that are not entirely correct, just because we have to answer 'something'. 
If possible a cut down version to help small concerns like ours would  perhaps provide a more meaningful response.","QUIQSOLUTIONS LIMITED","8J961","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Published","neal moores","nealmoores@quiqsolutions.com","Mar 29 2019 11:42AM"

Why?
1) most of this shouldn't need to apply to General Practice 
2) if there is an expectation this is so important and needs the time devoted to it that it has then perhaps the clear instructions and policies should be issued for users to adopt should they choose rather than expect each organisation to apply themselves to producing the same work (please don't use the working at scale line here!)
3) questions asked were generally 'woolly' and in several cases meaningless or irrelevant to a small General Practice.
4) Notwithstanding the GDPR rules; this exercise like the previous IG2K would appear designed to make those in their elevated towers feel increasingly comfortable that those beneath them have lots of policies and risk assessments in place to ensure that risks were well managed
5) the NHS is NOT very good at challenging illogical or unreasonable requests cascading out of the DoH or designing systems in a user friendly and relevant manner

As always I think that this is somewhat inappropriate for very small organisations like ours, that needs to do the small amount of processing well and not get overcomplicated. If people get confused by too much the core issues may suffer which is keep all data safe and secure and share appropriately. I think you should have separate toolkits for different types of organisations.","Dental Care with Jill Cooper (V10725)","V10725","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/Publications","jillian cooper","jill.cooper10@nhs.net","Mar 28 2019  4:33PM"

"Like","Like","I would like to suggest that if we do not have t complete certain sections because we have completed the PSNC GDPR Wookbook, Once that confirmation is made, then these sections should just just disappear from the toolkit. IT seems utterly pointless. Furthermore it really adds to the stress levels of the person completing the toolkit without any real benefit .
Furthermore, having published the toolkit it would be nice to get an email confirmation that it has been recieved and is complete.","THE PILLBOX PHARMACY (FR890)","FR890","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Publication/21562?HidePublishSectionOnReturn=True","dipak pau","pillboxpharmacy.greatbaddow@nhs.net","Mar 28 2019  3:31PM"

I think the CCG's should have the responsibility of answering their own questions on cyber security and then the practices answer their own specific questions.

it takes  a considerable amount of time  to complete and cannot be done while caring for patients which means completing out of surgery time and in personal time or at cost to the practice","OUTWOOD DENTAL PRACTICE (V02345)","V02345","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Published","christine gratton","outwooddentalcare.wakefield@nhs.net","Mar 27 2019  1:21PM"

"Dislike","Like","The new toolkit is very different from the 'old' toolkit.  The 'help' section is very useful.
Too many questions to test the knowledge of Practice Staff, as staff undergo annual training for many areas in General Practice, but this is not normally followed up with a questionnaire to test they have understood their training.  

Also, when loading information to the site, on occasions, this has been very slow.

Some of the questions are hard to interpret until you have selected and read the definition & not known to Practice without communication to the CCG and their feedback; how relevant is this to individual practices?","Enderby Medical Centre (C82631)","C82631","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","julie read","julie.read@gp-c82631.nhs.uk","Mar 27 2019 11:12AM"

"Dislike","Like","The content and wording of this ""updated"" toolkit is still full of technical jargon and therefore difficult and time consuming for non-specialist computer people to decipher. Far too much time has been spent in trying to figure out what the various questions are asking. You really need to get in touch with the campaign for plain English - I am sure they will be able to help you translate this toolkit into an understandable format.

The layout is an improvement on the IGT, but there are still questions/mandatory items which I feel are NOT really relevant to my sphere of practice. You really need to look at this aspect again. Basically this toolkit remains an irritating waste of my valuable time.","DENTAL SURGERY (V04108)","V04108","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Published","arthur mcgroarty","amcgroarty@msn.com","Mar 27 2019  9:09AM"

"Dislike","Like","The wording is not easy to interpret in some instances due to the high level of 'IT wording' that I am unfamiliar with. Some of the questions are outside the scope of a GP PM to complete and i have to say I am not entirely sure that i have completed everything correctly and that the supporting information we hold is sufficient. I would hope that any questions that do not have sufficient information are directed back to the practice for further information.  As a GP practice we take Data Protection and Information Governance extremely seriously and would hope that all our policies and procedures in these areas meet the required standards.","Sedbergh Health Centre (Lumb) (A82608)","A82608","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Published","tracy thornton","tracy.thornton@gp-a82608.nhs.uk","Mar 26 2019  1:54PM"

This is a generic assessment crossing the whole of the health and social care sector and I feel not taking into account various user levels.  I find it really hard to honestly answer some of the questions as they are more for our suppliers rather then a system user. We take data protection very seriously and have our 'local' policies which I hope I have answered and uploaded appropriately, but I would appreciate feedback and any other support to ensure the information is correct and meets the needs of this assessment, particularly if there are gaps we need to address.

Most of the standards make little sense and it seems ridiculous that every practice in the country has to recreate the same documents. I understand the importance of data protection but making almost every standard a mandatory one in the first year is extremely off putting. Once upon a time we had IG support within PCOs and there was even DES funding to support the first IG toolkit. All practice managers are chasing their tails to try and tick the boxes but will it really bring about any real change?

"Dislike","Like","Hi,

This feedback relates to the staff awareness questions.

I work for Midlands and Lancashire CSU and we provide IG support for a considerable number of CCG's across an area covering  Lancashire to Hereford/Worcester and the Midlands. 

The CSU has undertaken a Staff Awareness Survey across the CCG's which we support. This is a test run for when they become mandatory, but also to identify any existing concerns within the CCGs.

We have been receiving a lot of feedback which relates to the question  ""Used legally and securely-
I feel that confidentiality is more important than sharing information for care.""

The feedback is that people do not understand the question. This is evidenced in the survey results. This question scores one of the highest neutral response out of all of the questions.

Would it be possible for this question to be reviewed for the following toolkit - it may require different wording or an explanation to go with it.

Kind regards,

Adam Naylor (IG Business Partner, MLCSU)

"Dislike","Dislike","100 times worse than IG toolkit. Maybe apt for large organisation eg large hospital.Totally inapt for small single handed dental practice. Very badly worded, unclear, expects high level of IT and legal knowledge, so much background info leading from one link  to another to another with huge documents but not necessarily relevant or good models or clear answers, that it is decidedly unhelpful and near impossible to find what is relevant. Could literally spend all year doing nothing but this. Cannot even print out full list of questions with extra info it asks for when you click on it, it prints double over itself. Never known anything so badly designed. If you could score it out of 10 with 10 being the best and 0 the worst I would give it a minus score - minus 10, it is appalling. I think (like the govt does for IRMER) there desperately needs to be a simpler version apt for small practices where what needs concentrating on does not get lost among a host of other things. And that is written in comprehensible language.","Robin Smith Dental Practice (V05739RS)","V05739","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Publication/Published","robin smith","robin@robinsmithdental.co.uk","Mar 20 2019  8:20PM"

In particular I refer to ISO 27001 and Cyber Essentials Standard.  Both of these standards require organisations to implement controls that are very similar to a number of the assertions in the DSPT.

Some of the evidence requirements refer to ""in the last 12 months"" but when we followed this our auditors stated that it had to be from the current financial year. For example, if we have evidence of something from January 2018 this should have been valid for the Baseline in October 2018 as it is within the last 12 months, but the auditor stated it was invalid.

"Like","Like","Many Community Pharmacies have more than one system, for example a PMR system and an eMAR system or Pharmacy system, or a dispensing system. This makes filling in some of the fields a little more complex.

I've used the Assest register to overcome this.

In completing the forms for a number of Pharmacies I note that, as far as I can see, not all supliers have completed the toolkit. It would be useful to have  a list of suppliers and their ODS codes. Sometimes it's hard to find what name they use. The PSNC GDPR pages go some way towards this.

Also thank you to the Help Desk Staff who are really helpful and quick to respond.

Reards,

For hospitals and big corporations who have  high powered executives completing these toolkits as well as access to legal teams who complete all of their compliance documents, the wording and questions may seem straightforward but not for small businesses therefore I feel the toolkit should be simplified further.","APPOLLONIA DENTIST (V08087)","V08087","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","mona hookings","appolloniadental@gmail.com","Mar 12 2019  3:23PM"

We do this as a group meeting to get sign off from everybody involved and the clicking through pop up boxes makes this tedious.

But once again, LOVE the new design, HUGE improvement.","DAMIBU LTD","8JP11","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","John Callaghan","john_callaghan@damibu.com","Mar 11 2019  1:25PM"

We have had to contact our IT department to answer a significant element of this toolkit and we are already extremely busy with everyday operational work.  It would be really helpful if you could redefine these questions so that practices answer those applicable to them or have the option to put N/A - service level agreement in place with IT - please contact them - or in fact should they be doing this toolkit also.

The guidance on the subject has also been badly written and is nonsensical as it describes private dentists as working for the NHS, which is clearly the complete opposite.
The form is really not designed for small practices like ours, which have 1 single dentist. We do not have lots of staff members or complex IT systems and questions are really not tailored to dental services. I have tried to answer it as best as I can but some of the questions make no sense in our context.","DENTAL SURGERY (V02451)","V02451","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","penelope harris","pennydentist@hotmail.com","Mar  1 2019  1:43PM"

"Dislike","Dislike","Changing from the previous assessment style and basing it all online, adds to an evermore complex array of portals, websites and beyond that Pharmacies have to access an manage. 
It crashes with blank error messages every couple of minutes that seems to be related to timeouts and being logged out.

"Dislike","Dislike","The site is very glitchy. I have loaded a document 3 times and saved and it still isn't showing that the element is completed. I don't know where to look for documents that I have already loaded - or even if there IS somewhere to look. I think it will be highly unlikely that I will be able to complete this assessment by end of March.
I was able to complete the previous IG Toolkit relatively quickly because quite a few of the answers were unchanged. I can't say the same about this; especially when I am repeatedly having to input answers and yet the section isn't showing as completed.  It also appears that if you 'completed' a section but need to go back to it then it will now allow you to do it.
It appears to me that the same questions are being asked several different ways when one answer should be sufficient.
I am NOT enjoying this task at all!","The Old Links Surgery (P81737)","P81737","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","barbara wrench","barbara.wrench@nhs.net","Feb 18 2019  5:57PM"

"Dislike","Like","I have found this document extremely time consuming and have appeared to be answering the same sort of question over and over and having to evidence them with a form!    Forms, forms for everything and no time to complete them all!  
For example:   1.4.1 - register for sharing of personal information with legal basis,
1.4.4 - Asset register, 1.6.13 - Impact Assessments, 3.1.2 - data security & protection training needs analysis, 5.2.1 - copy of the process review meeting registration sheet, with signatures, 7.2.1 - incident and business continuity plan registration sheet with signatures, 9.3.1 - Annual IT Penetration Testing  documentation of negotiations, 9.4.3 - evidence of management discussed top three data protection risks,  that is to name just 8 forms to be completed annually or at intervals.
A great deal of the questions I could not understand as I work in pharmacy not in computer technology!  My boss a Director of our Company has completed computer work within his degree and he also had no idea what was required for a lot of the questions.  It seems far to in depth for our line of work and I hope I am not alone in my opinion.  
I think the toolkit could be a lot shorter with regard to Cyber questions and other questions on data reporting.  
Is it not sufficient, to ensure that each pharmacy has it's GDPR written into contracts and Data Policy available for customers to view, that staff have been trained on how to deal with breaches and who to contact in light of a breach and the consequences of a breach or sharing of passwords?  This would encompass, our dealings within our pharmacy roles and our required expectation when dealing with the general public, surely?  
Our GDPR update added to contracts was written by a solicitor and explains in depth the do's and don'ts of Data Security. 
Our computer systems are bought on contract and the computer company provide their own protection, so we don't know about AV tools, patching, Penetration tests etc.  Firewalls are there and password security, but the number of incidents caused by 'a known vulnerability being exploited' and 'Impact Assessments? - not a clue!  
I hope some of my notes are constructive as completing two of these documents has been totally frustrating, time absorbing and confusing.

If this is the requirement for a small dental practice then I think the world has gone completely mad!  The toolkit has taken so much of my time to complete I would say it has compromised the whole operation of the practice - creating and completing documents, lists and such to meet these requirements.  An organisation of 6 staff in 4 rooms has to have a good policy that is adhered to and needs to know what they are doing but this was serious overkill and other work has suffered to provide time to understand and fulfil requirements.","DENTAL SURGERY (V04926)","V04926","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","georgina hewson","worsbroughdentalpractice@nhs.net","Jan 30 2019 10:28AM"

To meet toolkit assertion Question 6 in the training follow-up survey, providers are asked to report that >80% of respondents agree or strongly agree that ?confidentiality is more important than sharing information for care?. However, this appears contradictory to the training (and law) as it is sometimes necessary to share information for the purposes of care.

However, there is no mention of the ISO Scope or Statement Of Applicability, both of which have a significant bearing on the relevance of the certification to the DSP Toolkit return.
To be fully compliant, the Scope has to cover ALL systems holding/processing relevant data, and the SOA would have to include all associated controls. These are both at the discretion of the organisation, and there is no requirement in the Standard to cover all systems or controls. 
May I suggest either a place to upload copies of these documents, or questions and radio buttons to confirm that all systems and appropriate controls were included.","NHS COUNTER FRAUD AUTHORITY","T1540","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","Simon Clark","simon.clark@nhscfa.gsi.gov.uk","Dec 28 2018 12:02PM"

Any attempt to investigate what is required for more than one assertion seems to lead to this pink error banner. I am assuming it is a very short timeout but as the banner doesn't explain the problem I am assuming that logging out and back in again is indeed the only way to be able to continue to expand the assertions.","Integris Solutions Limited","8JN41","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","Caroline Todd","caroline.todd@integrisltd.com","Dec 10 2018  2:37PM"

Therefore practices are being asked to verify that actions are being taken by others outside their organisation. Those supplying the IT will also be answering the same questions...
It just feels at a time when the NHS has no resources and time is incredibly limited that once again the government expect practices to complete toolkits that duplicate information supplied by others.
There is no consideration for modifying the tool kit in order to make it fit for purpose for general practice completion. 
e.g. whole sections should allow practices to tick that this is dealt with by their IT provider and the IT provider(s) should be named accordingly e.g. Local IT infrastructure provider, national Clinical system provider etc.
e.g. section 8 is all dealt with by our local IT supplier - so why do all practices nationally have to answer this. If the IT supplier is not up to standrd then this is for the NHS to take up with them.","Rainbow Medical Centre (N83001)","N83001","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","tracy steward","tracy.steward@sthelensccg.nhs.uk","Dec  6 2018 11:28AM"

"Like","Like","Data Security and Protection Incident Report No 6032 - Feedback for NHS Digital, NHS Bradford Districts CCG

1.	We believe we followed the NHS Digital guidance (September 2018) meticulously in reporting this Availability breach. In particular: 
a.	(p.9) ?GDPR definitions, notification and subject communication requirements will include breaches that organisations might not have notified under the previous data protection regime. The traditional view that a data breach is only reportable when data falls into the wrong hands is now replaced by a concept of a ?risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals? under Article 33 of GDPR.?
b.	(p.10) ?CIA Triad? plus definition of availability breach includes ?accidental loss of access to personal data?
c.	Our assessment of incident severity and likelihood suggested the ICO should be informed. 
2.	However, when our DPO contacted the ICO helpline for advice on a secondary matter, she was strongly advised that the ICO does not need to be notified of availability breaches such as this, where there is no question of exposing the personal data to unauthorised access.  When asked whether we should report any permanent loss of data that may materialise ? ie system fails to save GPs? updates to patient records and the updates are not subsequently retrievable ? again the answer was that this was not a matter for the ICO.
3.	In the interests of transparency and at the request of the Executive team, we have submitted the report anyway and await feedback in due course. The DPO put in a call to the NHS Helpdesk on 24th October, call log no. 347493. We are particularly concerned to obtain clarification on the apparent discrepancy between NHS Digital guidance and ICO advice.

"Dislike","Like","Why have non-mandatory evidence - either the organisation is required to comply or not.  Or, as per the previous toolkit - there were levels of compliance/achievement.

Overall - some of the assertions under the standards require a huge amount of resource to find/locate/maintain the evidence as they are currently worded. And the wording is confusing and inconsistent -   E.g. 10.3 All disputes between the organisation and its suppliers have been recorded and any risks posed to data security have been documented.  Evidence required: list of data security incidents ? past (2 years) or present with current suppliers.  

The questions in the ""survey"" are misleading - and the responses are unhelpful, because the response has been based on the misleading questions!  As this isn't mandatory - why are we doing it?

Complete the toolkit - so that mandatory and non-mandatory evidence requirement doesn't keep changing.  Stop tinkering!!!","SOUTHERN HEALTH NHS FOUNDATION TRUST","RW1","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment","lesley barrington","lesley.barrington@southernhealth.nhs.uk","Oct 25 2018 12:21PM"

Can I suggest that a tick box is added (not unlike the old version) as an added validation level, for the person adding the comment to physically tick if an assertion is complete, this would be for each sub area.

"Like","Like","I am completing the toolkit for my organisation, Gateshead Community Based Care Ltd, and am helping our four GP practices with theirs, which are as follows:
 
?	Blaydon GP Practice and MIU (Y02658)
?	Crawcrook Surgery (A85014)
?	Grange Road Medical Practice (A85620)
?	The Grove Centre (A85003)

All are registered with the ICO individually and so have to complete their own toolkit however they come under our umbrella and follow our policies and procedures. We are not a ?support organisation? like the CSU completing toolkits on behalf of CCGs however would benefit greatly from some functionality that would allow us to provide the same evidence in different toolkits.
 
A lot of the evidence I put in for us needs to go into the four practices toolkits as well, and I wondered whether there is an easier way of doing this other than having to go into all five toolkits and enter it manually?
 
Not everything is the same, as the practices have a different IT provider to us, but this is proving extremely time consuming for all involved to ensure we are all entering the same evidence where this is necessary.
 
It would help if there was a drop down menu for example to select which toolkits to add the evidence to.

Grateful if this could be considered.

Many thanks

Unfortunately I missed the 2nd Oct baseline webinar (please can these be recorded in future for access by administrators? - Webex facilitates this and subsequent download). I understand the purpose for the baseline submissions, but I would like to see more clarification regarding exactly what the baseline publication extracts from the main plan? Is this random? Is this specific selection to produce an overview? How exactly does this work? How does this requirement produce a consistent nationwide snapshot of progress. I appreciate if administrators new exact sample areas this may skew the data sampling, but I would still like to know more.

Is it trying to assess whether the organisation can be trusted to share data with, or is it trying to assess whether every single organisation is 100% DPA2018 / GDPR compliant as this would never be the case. for example, asking the date that the board approved all data flows in a local authority is ridiculous, as are some of the other questions. How is it actually relevant how compliant with FoI responses a local authority is? 

The whole set of questions need a total rewrite with the focus being on actual outcome of being compliant with the toolkit, and what it actually provides. Every single local authority will not meet this, and I can name a lot of NHS organisations also that will fail, and all this will do is put up more barriers to information sharing and at the end of the day, it is the public who will suffer.","Plymouth City Council","913","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/Details","john finch","john.finch@plymouth.gov.uk","Jul 25 2018  9:44AM"

the questions where statements are made i.e. not likely / likely/ highly likely/ occurred rather vague definitions would suggest free texts to enable details as to justification for chosen statement as erred on conservative side without still knowing the impacts as investigations are in their initial phases.
regarding the citizens rights statements these are joined together and some should be separated e.g. not likely or incident involved vulnerable groups - at this point we don't know if the patient B is a vulnerable hence choosing likely as there may be a chance......","COUNTY DURHAM AND DARLINGTON NHS FOUNDATION TRUST","RXP","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Incidents/1692/Summary","Lisa Nattrass","l.nattrass@nhs.net","Jul  6 2018 12:20PM"

"Like","Like","Something the previous NHS IGT didn't have and is essential. Completing an assessment is huge amount of work, as is uploading evidence. It would be helpful for users to be able to import from the previous assessment and to export the answers to the assessment to csv. This would then require aupdating and uploading of new/changed evidence. This would save an enormous amount of work. Whilst there is a risk to this with people not updating, quality assessment of the uploaded data would reduce this. Undertaking this assessments annually or more frequently is a huge cost to all organisations and must be a monumental one collectively for the NHS. As a private supplier to the NHS (no direct patient contact) I am very unwilling to undertake this exercise from scratch every year. When you factor in SEQOHS, ISO 9001/27001 (which we intend to accredit in the next two years) and this, it is too much cost to absorb and will result in higher charges to all clients, including the NHS, something we would like to avoid or allow us to specify standards such as Cyber Security Essentials or ISO 270001 to minimise questions - however you may have already done that as we haven't yet accredited to Cyber Essentials Plus (Q4 2018).","H M PARTNERSHIP LLP","AE4","https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Assessment/Details","eamonn swanton","eamonn.swanton@heales.com","Jul  4 2018  6:42PM"

The previous IG incident reporting tool also had a function which allowed you to input the criteria (number of individuals affected, etc.) which then gave an immediate, simple indication as to whether the incident was a ""Level 2"" SIRI - something similar to this would be helpful here as otherwise it is necessary to cross reference with the matrix within the reporting guidance to establish whether the incident should be reported or not. It would be ideal to have all of the relevant information available at the point of reporting.

Our IG team have entered two IG breaches on the new IG Toolkit and we are a little concerned at the feedback we have received.

The first incident was where 125 patients data was sent in error to the CQC.  Although the CQC would have had access to some of the information they would not have had access to all of the information.
1.       When reporting the breach in the new toolkit it confirmed that this was not an incident which we should report to the ICO.  
2.       Previously this incident would have been classified as a level 2 IG Breach which would have been reportable.
3.       Do we still send out the duty of candour letters in this situation as the breach is not reportable?
4.       Are we still expected to conduct an internal review?
5.       Do we have to report the breach to any other bodies?
6.       In this situation it was the CQC who actually informed us of the breach and told us to report the breach on the new toolkit as a level 2 breach but under the new process it is not reportable.
7.       It would be very helpful to understand why this is not reportable as a breach ? Is it because it went to a trusted partner organisation?

Today we reported a breach where a clinic letter was sent to the wrong recipient incident reference 1499.
1.       The letter contained sensitive healthcare data
2.       Previously this incident would have been classified as a level 2 IG Breach which would have been reportable.
3.       Do we still send out the duty of candour letter in this situation as the breach is not reportable?
4.       Are we still expected to conduct an internal review?
5.       Do we have to report the breach to any other bodies?
6.       It would be very helpful to understand why this is not reportable as a breach 
 
It would be useful to have a contact telephone number to discuss these issues with somebody and it would be helpful if these was an edit option when reviewing the incidents we have reported.
On the basis of the incidents we have reported to date based on the current reporting guidance I think there will be very few occasions when an incident is reported to the ICO.

The reporting tool we now use seems to be very high level and I am not sure if it captures all of the relevant IG information.

"Like","Like","The look and feel is significantly better than before.  being able to allocate an owner is also good but this could be scaled down further to create a 'task list'.  An owner could control the overall section but it would be ideal if you could allocate individual items as a task.  In our organisation, we have multiple staff answering questions within one section.  

The only way to know what you as an individual is to action is by making a comment but to view this, you have to open the item?

As an example are pen tests conducted annually - if the company performs pen tests but only on change or bi annually should it be blank (implying no pen tests are conducted) or a statement that there are on change (implying they are annual).

2.  When making entries on the completing the assssements there is no indications which of the NDG Standards is being worked on. e.g. Assessment - Assertions (8) would be better if headed ""Personal Confidential Data Assessment - Assertions (8)

3.  There is nowhere to make specific responses about "" ........ the content and wording used on the new pages"" or about ""........ the design and layout of the new pages"". Also the radio buttons are poor offering only a choice of ""Like"" or ""Dislike""

4. Clicking on the Helpdesk Portal to obtain a self-service account gives a ""Hmm. We?re having trouble finding that site. We can?t connect to the server at nww.ssdservicedeskbureau.nhs.uk"" message display. 
This is presumably because Ethitec haven't got an nww link but, if we can complete the Data Security & Protection Toolkit on a normal web link why can't everything else be done that way as the options for Feedback etc. appear on the Toolkit screens?

5. The View Progress option should have a description against each section instead of just being headed NDG Standard 1, NDG Standard 2 etc.

6.  The tick boxes on various mandatory assertions (e.g. ""There is a data protection and security induction in place for all new entrants to the organisation"") are not very prominent.

7. Incorrect display of apostrophes in assertion text (See Ethitec and then incorrect apostrophe display ISO9001:2015 Quality Standards document 1204 (Organisation Structure) which is a typical entry (this is our entry for List of Board Members in the Training section)

Also the declaration form will become part of the internal investigation report appendix to denote actions taken.  
Really need an export function please.

"Like","Like","I would like certainty regarding the organisation type that I have registered for within this DSPToolkit.

When I first registered my Hospice to complete the IG Toolkit (V14) one of your colleagues sent me a document ""Non-NHS IG Toolkit Organisation Types"". In this document the organisation type ""NHS Business Partner (NHSBP)/ITC/ALB"" specifically includes 'hospices', as a consequence this is the IG Toolkit we have completed.

However, most if not all the Hospices I have seen since seem to have or are completing the ""Voluntary Sector Organisation"" IG Toolkit. I believe this equates to organisation type 'Charity' when registering for DSPToolkit.

Could you:

a) determine which DSPToolkit a Hospice should complete
b) make that an option when selecting an organisation type to register as
c) or at least provide the definitions of each organisation type in a link on the page where you select the organisation type.
