# Coding Challenges 
This repository contains a set of coding challenges which have been used within the Exeter office of NHS Digital to provide a set of technical coding challenges for NHS Digital apprentice developers.

The challenges have been written to be at a similar level of complexity to the end of year technical test the apprentices will face and should test the following:

* How to read, understand and question acceptance criteria
* C# programming knowledge
* Common programming approaches and formats e.g. Checksums, hash functions, Hexadecimal etc.
* TDD and Unit Testing
* Mocking
* Coding to an interface
* Inheritance, Overloading, Overriding
* SOLID

## Challenges set

### You put a hex on me

**The challenge:** To write a function to convert an input 2 character string from hexadecimal to an integer value

**Areas for test/understanding:**
* C# language skills
* Unit testing
* Knowledge of Hexadecimal
* String manipulation
* Concerting characters to ASCII valiues

### Clockwork (part 1)

**The challenge:** To implement a function to derive the correct values to pass to a driver interface for displaying the current time on an Led clock.

**Areas for test/understanding:**
* Use of interfaces
* Dependency Injection
* Unit Testing
* Mocking
* Date/time manipulation in C#

### Summat needs checking

**The challenge:** Write a function to check the format and validity of s imple checksum for an input Helpdesk reference

**Areas for test/understanding:**
* C# language skills
* Regular expressions
* Unit testing
* LINQ (optional use in solution)
* ASCII values for characters

### Look before you leap

**The challenge:** Write a function to check if an input year is a leap year

**Areas for test/understanding:**
* C# language skills
* Analysis skills
* Coding efficient algorithms
* Unit testing
* Confidence building

### You feeling lucky punk

**The challenge:** Write a function to create a "Lucky dip" of lottery numbers.  Design in such a way can be used for other lotteries with different number sets, number of choices to make etc.

**Areas for test/understanding:**
* C# language skills
* Use of mathematical random functions
* USe of collections
* Design - Open/Closed principle, Template method pattern etc.
* Deliberately quite easy so can focus on the design aspects

### Call me Hendrix
**The challenge:** Use LINQ to manipulate and interrogate feedback provided by customers via a CSV file

** Area for test/understanding:**
* C# language skills
* LINQ
* CSV/CSVHelper
* System.IO

### Some regular exercise

**The challenge:** To write a series of regular expressions to test for various patterns.  Unit tests written to test any expressions authored in the Expressions.cs class

**Areas for test/understanding:**
* Regular expressions
* Captured groups
* C# Regular Expression and Match class
