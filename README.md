# Coding Challenges 
This repository contains a set of coding challenges which have been used within the Exeter office of NHS Digital to provide a set of technical coding challenges for NHS Digital apprentice developers.

The challenges have been written to be at a similar level of complexity to the end of year technical test the apprentices will face and should test the following:

* How to read, understand and question acceptance criteria
* C# programming knowledge
* Common programming approaches and formats e.g. Checksums, hash functions, Hexadecimal etc.
* TDD and Unit Testing
* Mocking
* Coding to an interface
* Inheritance, Overloading, Overriding
* SOLID
